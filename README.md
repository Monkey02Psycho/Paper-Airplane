# Paper-Airplane
### Preamble
game design is tough. this is my first time using GDscript for anything larger then roughly 25 lines. The code is messy. the project is not well structured. The game is full of bugs. over all I think this project turned out well. I learned a lot about game design and the importance of proper names. I also got a chance to properly use more complex data structers like list and dictionaries. Now lets take a deeper dive into my learning.
